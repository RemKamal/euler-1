# Project Euler

These are my solutions to the [Project Euler][1] problems, written in Rust and Julia.

[1]: http://projecteuler.net

## Usage

### Rust solutions

Compile `test.rs` and run the resulting executable with no arguments to check and benchmark all solutions. To just look at one solution, supply the problem's number as a command-line argument.

### Julia solutions

Use `julia test.jl` or `julia test.jl N` the same way that you use the Rust binary.
